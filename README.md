# work-day-scheduler

## Description 

Created script.js to make a functional scheduler to show the current day displayed at the top of the calendar. Next, when you scroll down there will be color coded time blocks for your text that will change colors depending on your current time. Grey means past, red means present and green means future. When you enter text into the text block it will save to local storage and it will stayed rendered to the page even when you refresh the page.
